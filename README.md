In this Game, we are supposed to shoot the Mad Android using the mouse controls to fire the projectile, and 
W : Forward
A : Strafe Left
S : Move Back
D : Strafe Right

to fly through the world.


We can Also use the Observation Mode to "Pause" The game while, and the fly through and observer the the path our projectile is takin !!

And yeah, there is this unique thing about your Ammo in the Game. Your ammo is actually a ball, which can very well bounce and stuff, but after a fixed number of bounces, it changes into a bomb, it all begins with the ammo in your level one, which needs 1 bounce to change into a bomb....

You can always exit the game by pressing Escape Key

Happy Hunting.
